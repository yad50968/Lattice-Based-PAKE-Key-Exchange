# Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange from Lattices

## Introduction
This project implements the protocol based on paper : Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange from Lattices for Client/Server Model, CISC, 2017

## Project Structure
```
Lattice-Based-PAKE-Key-Exchange
  |-- Client_Desktop : Client for Desktop
  |-- Client_Phone : Client for Android
  |-- Server  : Server side
```

## Run
### All sub-projects can be build with gradle
#### Step 1
